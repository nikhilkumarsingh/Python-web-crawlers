I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted.



The sign of a beautiful person is that they always see beauty in others.


I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.


A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.


To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.


It is not beauty that endears, it’s love that makes us see beauty.


We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone.


Each of us can look back upon someone who made a great difference in our lives, someone whose wisdom or simple acts of caring made an impression upon us. In all likelihood it was someone who sought no recognition for their deed other than the joy of knowing that, by their hand, another's life had been made better.


It is one of the most beautiful compensations of life, that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.


Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light.


To strengthen the muscles of your heart, the best exercise is lifting someone else's spirit whenever you can.


If everyone helps to hold up the sky, then one person does not become tired.


We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.


Where there is unity there is always victory.


So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth.

If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace. 


The dictionary is the only place that success comes before work. Hard work is the price we must pay for success. I think you can accomplish anything if you're willing to pay the price.


Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted.


It seems the harder I work, the more luck I have.


The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.


Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. 


Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers.


Reading is a way for me to expand my mind, open my eyes, and fill up my heart.


Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.


The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.


A room without books is like a body without a soul.


Go forward in life with a twinkle in your eye and a smile on your face, but with great purpose in heart.


Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.


A warm smile is the universal language of kindness.


What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. These are but trifles, to be sure; but scattered along life's pathway, the good they do is inconceivable.
